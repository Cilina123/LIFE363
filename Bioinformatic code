# Define selections for hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and neutral residues
select hydrophobic, resn ALA+VAL+LEU+ILE+MET+PHE+TYR+TRP
select hydrophilic, resn LYS+ARG+HIS+ASP+GLU+SER+THR+ASN+GLN
select neutral, resn GLY+PRO+CYS

# Apply colors to each selection
color lightpink, hydrophobic
color palecyan, hydrophilic
color lightblue, neutral

# Display the structure as cartoon or surface to highlight these properties
